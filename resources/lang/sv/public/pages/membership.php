        <p>By becoming a supporting member you are co-owning and co-funding the financial means we together can use to strengthen local food. Means we together decide how to use, and what developing efforts regarding local farming, local distribution, access to local food we will support, in order to increase the quota of locally produced food we eat.</p>

    <p>For this reason all economic data within LOCAL FOOD NODES will be accessible in real time; what the costs are, where, how and why money is spent, and how they are making an impact, and we also going to be able to have a say of how the economic means will be used.</p>',
