        <h2>Co-own the future of food!</h2>
        <p class="text-muted">Become a member, become a part of the future of food</p>
        <p>As supporting members, we all of us together, give ourselves the economic powers to choose the direction for the future of food.</p>

        <p>By becoming a supporting member you are co-owning and co-funding the financial means we together can use to strengthen local food. Means we together decide how to use, and what developing efforts regarding local farming, local distribution, access to local food we will support, in order to increase the quota of locally produced food we eat.</p>

        <p>Local Food Nodes is an open tool to crowdfund the local way of producing and distributing food.
        And we do it together by the annual decide-the-size-yourself membership fee.</p>

        <h3>This is what your money do.</h3>
        <p>Local Food Node sets an annual budget every year to be able to run the platform and carry its costs.
        All income above this is reinvested in development in the interest of local food.</p>

        <p>As a member you are a part of creating the means to make this happen. You can also be a deciding part how the money will be spent.
        It is we as members that together point out the direction and decide what project our money shall support. It can be supporting new local food nodes, supporting start-up farming, creating of tool pools and else.</p>

        <h3>Full transparency.</h3>
        <p>In the same way we see that it is crucial for a future food system to be transparent and totally owned by the producers and end-consumes together, we also see the necessity of together owning the needed digital tools, the developing tools, the financial means and economic tools to make things happen, as we together see fit.</p>

        <p>For this reason all economic data within LOCAL FOOD NODES will be accessible in real time; what the costs are, where, how and why money is spent, and how they are making an impact, and we also going to be able to have a say of how the economic means will be used.
